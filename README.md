# About me ðŸ”­

I am a French web developer looking for a first opportunity through an internship. During my training, I specialized in backend development including REST APIs, database components, server-client communication, and deployment.

In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects that can make a difference in my life or someone else's, even if it's simply by making them laugh or saving them a bit of time.

I am currently working on my Next.js portfolio which I will deploy through GitHub Pages. 

Other than that, I have worked on a variety of projects, most notably [codeclicker](https://codeclicker.dev/), which is a fun and interactive idle clicker game featuring lighthearted references to the process of learning how to code. I built it with the help of four other students over the course of a month. It was a really fun project which taught me a lot about web development, deployment, design, data management, and many other things.

More recently, I worked on an ambitious project dedicated to the game "Wakfu". The main idea was to automatically retrieve the JSON data from the official website API in order to keep a MongoDB database up to date with the game updates, using that data to allow users to look for, filter, and select items based on most if not all of their properties.
